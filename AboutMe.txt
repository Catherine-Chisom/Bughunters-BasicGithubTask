Hello there,

My name is Chisom Catherine Dick, I work as a QA Engineer that is committed to delivering quality products. I utilize diverse tools to ensure that my testing process goes as planned.
Asides that, I am also a technical writer that takes pride in taking down details and findings about a tech tool that will be useful to beginners and users of a product. This helps people properly navigate their way and note what next to do with their lives.

I'm also happy to support a local community of women back home. Helping them navigate the intricacies of tech, to make a better career decision.
